Virtual Tour based Restaurant Table Reservation

The Web Based project which provides the Virtual Tour of the Restaurants (Currently only 1 Restauranti.e Royal Dine) and allows the user to visualize (look & feel) prior to the visit. Particular user can Reserve the Table/spot of their own choice by just Clicking the Table/spot from the virtual tour , the request is directly send to the manager for approval and the user gets the notification if the request is approved.


Techniacally Speaking:-
- For virtual tour "KrPano Library is being used".
- XML structure to make virtual tour more interacive and cusomizable (i.e cliclable hotsposts)

Further Improvements to be done:-
- To revert the color of the already booked table to red,after syncing with the database servers.
- To Disable the Hotspots of the Already booked table at particular time the current user is requesting after login and befofre the virtual   tour.
- Tranform to server based application and store all the virtual tours on dedicated servers.
- As soon as Manager approves the request, the Seven Segment Display at the restaurant site on table should display Reserved.
